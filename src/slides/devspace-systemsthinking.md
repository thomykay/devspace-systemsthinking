# Systems Thinking - ganz praktisch

 Egal ob es um die Situation in Deinem **Team**, die **Firma** in der Du arbeitest, Deine **persönliche Weiterentwicklung** oder um große **globale Themen** geht: Sich „ein Bild“ von der Welt zu machen ist nicht einfach. Um komplexe Systeme und deren Wirkzusammenhänge zu verstehen, existieren eine Reihe **mentale Modelle** und zugehörigen Visualisierungstechniken.

Wir werden ausgewählte – z. B. **Current Reality Trees**, **Future Reality Trees**, **Causal Loop Diagrams** und **Archetypes** – kennenlernen und sie auf praktische Alltagssituationen anwenden.

Nach dem Workshop werdet ihr „eure Systeme“ wieder ein bisschen gezielter beeinflussen und verbessern können.

# What is Systems Thinking?

* the ability or skill to perform problem solving in complex system
* Systems thinking is your ability to see things as a whole (or holistically) including the many different types of relationships between the many elements in a complex system.

> The same old thinking will create the same old results, thus we need to start by changing our way of thinking and looking at the world.

# What is a Mental Model?

A mental model is an **explanation of how something works**. The phrase “mental model” is an overarching term for any sort of concept, framework, or worldview that you carry around in your mind.

Mental models help you **understand life**.

# Causal Loop Diagrams (CLD)

* What are the aspects and boundaries of the system in focus?
* What's the detail level we want to look at?

* ➡️ Don't try to build "the whole system" from the beginning
* Which problem are we looking at with the model to be created?

> Example: "We observe again and again that we have to push a lot of short-cycle hotfixes after each release. This causes a lot of stress in the teams and our users are obviously not really satisfied either. Let's try to model these problems in a causal loop diagram."

---

# Building a CLD (1) - Identify System Variables

* What variables are there in our system that might have something to do with our problem?
* ➡️ Be precise in naming the variables, ideally make them quantitative

![bg right width:600](drawings/cld.exercise.1.drawio.svg)

---

# Building a CLD (2) - Dynamics and changes of system variables

* What relation can be established between individual system variables?
* Do two system variables influence each other directly or are other variables involved?
* Which other aspects play a role in the environment of an identified variable?

# Building a CLD (3) - Reinforcement and weakening of system variables

# CLD Archetypes

Source: [Tools for Systems Thinkers: The 12 Recurring Systems Archetypes](https://medium.com/disruptive-design/tools-for-systems-thinkers-the-12-recurring-systems-archetypes-2e2c8ae8fc99)

Archetypes are recurring patterns of behavior that give insights into the structures that drive systems. They offer a way of deciphering systems dynamics across a diversity of disciplines, scenarios, or contexts.

Think of these archetypes as the **storylines of systems in the world**. Just as you can identify the same formula for a romantic comedy or a thriller in a Hollywood film, these archetypes help systems thinkers see behaviors and flows in more concrete terms.

---

# Archetypes

1. Drifting Goals
2. Escalation
3. Fixes That Fail
4. Growth and Underinvestment
5. Limits to Success
6. Shifting the Burden
7. Successful to the Successful
8. Tradegy of the Commons

See [Details](../material/system%20archetypes.md)

---

# Archetypes - Fixes that Fail

![bg left width:100%](.drawings/../drawings/archetypes.fixes-that-fail.drawio.svg)

a “quick-fix” solution can have unintended consequences that exacerbate the problem. It hypothesizes that the problem symptom will diminish for a short while and then return to its previous level, or become even worse over time.

For more, [see here](../material/system%20archetypes.md).

---

# Fixes that Fail

## Real World Examples

* Taking a headache pill under stress
* Short-term diets
* Inflate leaking tires again and again

## SWDev Examples

* Disabling Unit Tests
* Adding more CPU to a badly designed database

---

# Archetypes - Tragedy of the Commons

![bg left width:100%](./drawings/archetypes.tragedy-of-the-commons.drawio.svg)

identifies the causal connections between individual actions and the collective results (in a closed system).

It hypothesizes that if the total usage of a common resource becomes too great for the system to support, the commons will become overloaded or depleted and everyone will experience diminishing benefits.

For more, [see here](../material/system%20archetypes.md).

---

# Tragedy of the Commons

## Real World Examples

* Toilet Paper in 2020
* Global CO2 Emmissions
* Free Coffee in Coworking Spaces

## SWDev Examples

* Hitting refresh over and over when your test environment won’t load because everyone is overloading the dev server by hitting refresh.
* ...

---

# Tragedy of the Commons

## SWDev Examples continued

* Teams don’t volunteer to upgrade dependencies because they all have their own milestones to meet, and eventually an upgrade would be a nightmare because they waited too long.

More on [“The tragedy of the commons” in software development](https://critter.blog/2020/12/10/the-tragedy-of-the-commons-in-software-development/)

### Related SWDev Antipatterns, Patterns

* Broken Window
* Short-term over long term
* Boyscout Rule

---

# Archetypes - Successful to the Successful

![bg left width:100%](./drawings/archetypes.successful-to-the-successful.drawio.svg)

states that if one person or group (A) is given more resources than another equally capable group (B), A has a higher likelihood of succeeding.

It hypothesizes that A’s initial success justifies devoting more resources to A, further widening the performance gap between the two groups over time.

For more, [see here](../material/system%20archetypes.md).

---

# Successful to the Successful

## Real World Examples

* Tax revenue and economic power in federal states
* Investment opportunities for successful startups

## SWDev Examples

* Machine Learning: Training data for a good image recognition engine
* Contributions for a widely used open source package
* Great developers going to companies with more great developers

# CLD Archetypes - Exercise 1

Pick one of the archetypes not covered so far, understand and discuss them with your group and prepare to explain it to the whole group afterwards.

|Time|What|
|--|--|
|🕜5min|🧍Read about the archetype individually.|
|🕜5min|🧑🏻‍🤝‍🧑🏼 What's the essence of this archetype?|
|🕜5min|🧑🏻‍🤝‍🧑🏼 Where can it applied in the real world? Find a few examples|

---

# Systems Archetypes - Recap

* Archetypes are "repeating stories" in our systems
* These archetypes can be visualized, understood and detected by using CLDs
* They can help us to connect our practices, the patterns (and antipatterns we know) and the underlying fundamental principles how systems work
* Hence they can help us to act as a starting point for an invitation for change.

# CLD Archetypes - Excercise 2

Go back to your scenario and the respective CLD from earlier today.

1. (Inspect) Can you spot any archetypes in your CLD? Mark them.
2. (Inspect) Going back to the scenario, are there ways to see and describe them with the help of archetypes?
3. (Adapt) Improve the CLD describing your scenario.
4. (Adapt) Knowing the underlying archetypes, what could be possible interventions to improve the situation?
