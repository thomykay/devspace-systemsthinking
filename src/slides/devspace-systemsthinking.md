# Systems Thinking - ganz praktisch

 Egal ob es um die Situation in Deinem **Team**, die **Firma** in der Du arbeitest, Deine persönliche Weiterentwicklung oder um große **globale Themen** geht: Sich „ein Bild“ von der Welt zu machen ist nicht einfach. Um komplexe Systeme und deren Wirkzusammenhänge zu verstehen, existieren eine Reihe **mentale Modelle** und zugehörigen Visualisierungstechniken.

Wir werden ausgewählte – z. B. Ladder of Inference, **Causal Loop Diagrams**, **Current Reality Trees und Future Reaility Trees** – kennenlernen und sie auf praktische Alltagssituationen anwenden. Nach dem Workshop werdet ihr „eure Systeme“ wieder ein bisschen gezielter beeinflussen und verbessern können.

# What is a System?

# What is Systems Thinking?

* is the ability or skill to perform problem solving in complex system
* Systems thinking is your ability to see things as a whole (or holistically) including the many different types of relationships between the many elements in a complex system.

> The same old thinking will create the same old results, thus we need to start by changing our way of thinking and looking at the world.

# Current Reality Tree

...is a tool to **analyze** many systems or organizational problems at once. By **identifying root causes** common to most or all of the problems, a CRT can greatly aid focused improvement of the system. A current reality tree is a **directed graph**.

# What is a Mental Model?

A mental model is an **explanation of how something works**. The phrase “mental model” is an overarching term for any sort of concept, framework, or worldview that you carry around in your mind.

Mental models help you **understand life**.

# Causal Loop Diagrams (CLD)

![bg right width:600](drawings/cld.example.population.0.drawio.svg)
aid in visualizing how different variables in a system are causally interrelated. The diagram consists of a set of words and arrows. Causal loop diagrams are accompanied by a narrative which describes the causally closed situation the CLD describes.

# CLD - Building a CLD - Before you start

Source: [Systems Thinking mit Causal-Loop-Diagrammen](https://agilecoach.de/wissen/systems-thinking-mit-causal-loop-diagrammen/)

* What are the aspects and boundaries of the system in focus?
* What's the detail level we want to look at?

* ➡️ Don't try to build "the whole system" from the beginning
* Which problem are we looking at with the model to be created?

> Example: "We observe again and again that we have to push a lot of short-cycle hotfixes after each release. This causes a lot of stress in the teams and our users are obviously not really satisfied either. Let's try to model these problems in a causal loop diagram."

# Building a CLD (1) - Identify System Variables

* What variables are there in our system that might have something to do with our problem?
* ➡️ Be precise in naming the variables, ideally make them quantitative

![bg right width:600](drawings/cld.exercise.1.drawio.svg)

---

# Building a CLD (2) - Dynamics and changes of system variables

* What relation can be established between individual system variables?
* Do two system variables influence each other directly or are other variables involved?
* Which other aspects play a role in the environment of an identified variable?

![bg left width:600](drawings/cld.exercise.2.drawio.svg)

# Building a CLD (3) - Reinforcement and weakening of system variables

* If variable A changes upward, that is, becomes stronger, higher, or more in its expression, how does variable B change?

# Addendum - CLD Archetypes

Source: [Tools for Systems Thinkers: The 12 Recurring Systems Archetypes](https://medium.com/disruptive-design/tools-for-systems-thinkers-the-12-recurring-systems-archetypes-2e2c8ae8fc99)

Archetypes are recurring patterns of behavior that give insights into the structures that drive systems. They offer a way of deciphering systems dynamics across a diversity of disciplines, scenarios, or contexts.

Think of these archetypes as the **storylines of systems in the world**. Just as you can identify the same formula for a romcom or a thriller in a Hollywood film, these archetypes help systems thinkers see behaviors and flows in more concrete terms.

---

# Archetypes - Example - Fixes that Fail

![bg left width:600](../material/graphics/archetypes.fixes-that-fail.drawio.svg)

a “quick-fix” solution can have unintended consequences that exacerbate the problem. It hypothesizes that the problem symptom will diminish for a short while and then return to its previous level, or become even worse over time.

For more, see here.

* Drifting Goals
* Escalation

* Growth and Underinvestment
* Limits to Success
