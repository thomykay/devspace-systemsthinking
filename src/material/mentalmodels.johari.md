## What is the Johari Window Model about?

When someone exhibits behaviour that is perceived to be disturbing by their environment, it is good to give them feedback on it. For many, it can be very difficult to confront others on their behaviour. People are not always aware of their own behaviour, or perhaps they are aware of their behaviour, but will not easily admit it.

The Johari Window is a practical tool to illustrate and improve self awareness and mutual understanding between individuals, for example team members. The model can furthermore be used to improve the relationship of one group with another group, group development and group dynamics. Because of this, the model is often used to support team development.

The Johari window was created in 1955 by Joseph Luften and Harrington Ingham. This happened while researching group dynamics at the University of California. The name is derived from the first names of the creators. The Johari window can help people to better understand their communication with others.

## Quadrants

### Open Space: Known to you – Known to others

This Open Space or open area is about the behaviour that is known by you and also seen and acknowledged by others. You can communicate about this.

Still, it sometimes happens that there is behaviour that is disturbing to the environment, where someone is aware that it is. Patience and caution are important when discussing this behaviour with someone.

The open quadrant corresponds to all the things everyone knows about you. For example, a carpenter and the people around him know that he is a specialist in making window frames. Besides that, they know that he loves beautifully finished products, respects others and always makes time to help others.

### Blind Spot: Unknown to yourself – Known to others

The blind area quadrant of the Johari Window represents things you don’t know about yourself, but others do. For example, it can happen that a new employee is late for a meeting.

The person moderating the meeting answers the questions briefly and returns to where the meeting left off. The new employee later comes to the moderator and tells him that what he did was rude.

The moderator explains the new employee that he may have appeared curt. This is because he started the meeting on time for those who really needed it.

In this way, the moderator indicates something to the new employee that he did not know before, so that the employee can take his blind behaviour into account in future interactions.
The Blind Spot or blind area can be very difficult to manage, and can cause others to talk about you.

This is because they can see something that you don’t. Perspiration odour, the frequent use of the same word or continuous pulling of the nose are other examples of this.

The Blind Spot can also occur in the working environment. Someone can be unaware of the fact that he works slower than his colleagues. Others are aware of this, however, which can cause certain irritations. If feedback is not given properly to another, he will stay stuck in his old behavior and is likely to fall outside the group.

### Hidden Area: Known to yourself – Unknown to others

In the Hidden Area, people can keep certain information to themselves and not share it with others. The office clerk can keep hidden from his colleagues that in his free time he is a jazz guitarist.

The Hidden Area can also be unknown to a limited number of other people. The same office clerk may have a good colleague with whom he does share his hobby, making it a subject for communication. In that case, this Hidden Area slowly shifts to Open Space.

So the hidden quadrant contains things that you know yourself, but others don’t. Self-disclosure increases through interaction, creating potential to learn about where someone grew up, what family values someone was taught and what experiences someone has had.

As soon as one person learns more about another person, this hidden window gets smaller and the open window gets bigger.

### Unknown Area: Unknown to yourself – Unknown to others

No communication exists about this Unknown Area. Purely because of the fact that both parties are unaware of it, which means it won’t become the subject of discussion.

The unknown quadrant contains information about a person’s behaviour, beliefs and feelings. These are not known to anyone, including the person in question. There are many situations wherein a person’s strengths and weaknesses first come to the fore. For example, how does an intern react to his or her first overtime?

## Use of the Johari Window

Most people try to communicate using only the Open Space. Eye contract, body language and styles of communication are overlooked. Hiding feelings or thoughts form others can create challenging moments of communications that are criticized by others who might see something incorrectly.

A person with healthy self-esteem can respond in a way that reveals something from the Blind Spot. If a person is open to constructive criticism, the information moves to the Open Space / open area and healthy interaction can take place. Everyone has different styles of communication, different temperaments and personal stressors that are often kept out of professional life.

The Johari Window is effective in helping to understand the relationship between employee and employer and to help build trust. It is also referred to as a disclosure model, or self awareness model, as an extention of emotional intelligence. For some people, the method serves as an information processing aid and increases self awareness.

This window represents information about experiences, attitudes, skills and motivations of a particular person in relation to the group that person is in. This information is described from four perspectives, whereby it becomes clear which information is or is not known to the person himself and/or to others.

The model can be used to describe the same information about a group in relation to another group as well.
