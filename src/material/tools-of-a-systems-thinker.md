## Interconnectedness

Systems thinking requires a shift in mindset, away from linear to circular motivated by the underlying principle that everything needs something else (or a combination of things) to continue; in other terms – everything is interconnected.

## Synthesis

Synthesis is the combining of two or more things to create something new. Systems thinking aims to examine and understand the whole and the parts simultaneously, along with the interconnectedness that make up the dynamics of the whole. This is contrasted by analysis that breaks up complexity into manageable bits.

## Emergence

Emergence is the natural outcome of things coming together, or the larger biproduct of different parts of the system interacting with each other.

## Feedback Loops

Because everything in a system is interconnected, there are constant feedback loops and flows between respective elements. Learning about their type and dynamics can help us observe, understand, and intervene in those feedback loops.

## Causality

Understanding feedback loops is about appreciating causality, or how one thing results in another thing in a dynamic and constantly evolving system.

## Systems mapping

Systems mapping is an important tool that allows systems thinkers to identify and map the elements of ‘things’ within a system to understand how they interconnect, relate and act in a complex system. This can provide unique insights to inform decision-making and shifts that will dramatically change the system in the most effective way.
